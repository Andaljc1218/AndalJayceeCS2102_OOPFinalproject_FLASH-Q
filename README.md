Flashcard Quiz System

I. Project Overview

The Flashcard Quiz System is a console-based Java application designed to aid users in learning and self-assessment by creating, managing, and taking quizzes with flashcards. The program prioritizes user-specific data privacy, enabling users to maintain their own flashcards and quiz results independently. It is structured with robust error handling and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for scalability and modularity.

Key Features

1. User Account Management:
(a) Register new accounts securely.
(b) Log in functionality with validation against stored credentials.
(c) Unique flashcard storage for each user, ensuring data privacy.

2. Flashcard Management:
(a) Add flashcards by selecting a type:
	Identification Flashcards: Open-ended questions with textual answers.
	True/False Flashcards: Binary questions with true/false answers.
(b) Remove, edit, and display stored flashcards with seamless file updates.

3. Quiz Functionality:
(a) Take quizzes on specific flashcard types or a randomized set.
(b) Features to skip, reveal, and revisit skipped questions during the quiz.
(c) Tracks and displays scores for each type of quiz after completion.

4. File Storage:
(a) User accounts and flashcards are stored in text files for simplicity and portability.

II. Application of OOP Principles

The project employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance design clarity, scalability, and maintainability:

1. Encapsulation: Protects data integrity by limiting how external classes interact with internal class states.
(a) All class fields are declared as private to restrict direct access.
(b) Controlled access to data is provided via getter and setter methods in classes like Flashcard and UserAccount.

2. Polymorphism: Allows consistent handling of different flashcard types using a common interface while enabling unique functionalities.
(a) The Flashcard class is an abstract parent class, with IdentificationFlashcard and TrueFalseFlashcard as its concrete implementations.
(b) Methods like displayFlashcard() and validateAnswer() are overridden in child classes to provide type-specific behavior.

3. Abstraction: Simplifies interaction with flashcards by focusing on high-level operations

(a) The abstract Flashcard class defines the core structure and common behaviors (e.g., getQuestion()) for all flashcards.
(b) Internal implementation details, such as question validation, are hidden and customized in child classes.

4. Inheritance: Encourages code reuse and simplifies the addition of new flashcard types in the future.
(a) IdentificationFlashcard and TrueFalseFlashcard inherit from the abstract Flashcard class.
(b) Shared functionality is implemented in the parent class, reducing redundancy.

III. Chosen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)

SDG 4: Quality Education 
	This Java console program directly supports SDG 4 by providing a digital platform to improve learning outcomes and promote self-directed education.

Integration of SDG into the Project:

1. Accessibility:
	 Flashcard Quiz System can be used by students, teachers, or lifelong learners to create tailored learning experiences. Operable on any device with Java, making it accessible to a wide audience without the need for advanced tools or infrastructure.
2. Personalized Learning:
	Users can design flashcards based on their unique needs, enabling focused learning and effective knowledge retention.
3. Engagement:
	Interactive quiz features, such as revisiting skipped questions and scoring, encourage active learning.
4. Future Scalability (Possible improvements:
	The modular design allows future integration of features like multimedia flashcards, progress tracking, and multi-language support.

IV. Instructions for Running the Program

Prerequisites:
1. Code Editor or IDE: e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.
2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
3. File Structure Setup: Organize the files as described in the File Structure section.

Steps to Run:

1. Download and Place Files
Save all the .java files (e.g., Main.java, UserAccount.java, FlashcardManager.java, QuizManager.java, Flashcard.java, TrueFalseFlashcard.java, IdentificationFlashcard.java) into a single folder named flashcard-system.

 Folder Structure:

```
flashcard-system/
├── Main.java
├── UserAccount.java
├── FlashcardManager.java
├── QuizManager.java
├── Flashcard.java
├── TrueFalseFlashcard.java
└── IdentificationFlashcard.java
```

2. Create and Place Supporting Files:

2.1 accounts.txt:
	This file stores user credentials (username,password).
	Place it in the same folder (flashcard-system).
	If it doesn't exist, the program will create it automatically on account registration.

3. Compile the Program:

	Open a terminal or command prompt.
	Navigate to the flashcard-system folder.

4. Run the Program:

After successful compilation, run the program by executing:
-java Main

File Structure
Your project folder should look like this:

```
flashcard-system/
├── Main.java
├── UserAccount.java
├── FlashcardManager.java
├── QuizManager.java
├── Flashcard.java
├── TrueFalseFlashcard.java
├── IdentificationFlashcard.java
├── accounts.txt (optional, created automatically if not present)
```
